1) Duplicate the template (so the original stays untouched)

In Lovable AI: open your I Website Design project → click Duplicate / Remix / Fork (wording varies) → rename to KTL — Live.

Turn Draft/Preview on. Don’t publish until the QA step at the end.

2) Set brand colors (global)

Use your colors everywhere, leave layout, spacing, and components unchanged.

Palette

Primary: #8B0000 (Dark Red)

Accent: #0EA5A5 (Soft Teal)

Text: #222222

Background: #FFFFFF

Muted gray (borders/labels): #666666

If the template supports a Theme/Brand panel

Primary = #8B0000

Secondary/Accent = #0EA5A5

Links/Hover = Accent

Buttons: Primary background #8B0000, text #FFFFFF

If there’s a “Custom CSS / Code” box, drop this in:

:root{
  --brand-red:#8B0000;
  --brand-accent:#0EA5A5;
  --text:#222; --muted:#666; --bg:#fff;
}
a { color: var(--brand-accent); }
.btn-primary,.button-primary{ background:var(--brand-red); color:#fff; }
.btn-primary:hover,.button-primary:hover{ opacity:.92; }
.tag, .pill { background:#f7f7f7; color:var(--text); }

3) Swap branding (logo & favicon)

Upload KTL logo (dark red on white for light sections; white/mono for dark strips).

Favicon: a simple “KTL” mark in dark red on white background works fine.

4) Keep the same nav — just rename items

Use these titles (same order/structure as template):

Home, About, Sustainability, Certifications, Clients, Careers, Investors, Contact

Set primary CTAs (top-right buttons) to:

“Careers”

“Investor Info”

5) Paste-ready content (section by section)

Use the blocks below to replace only the text and images. Layout stays the same.
